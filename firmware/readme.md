The microcontroller is a Teensy 3.2 and the firmware is written as a Arduino sketch.

I used Arduino v1.8.2 with Teensyduino installed.

Libraries:

 * FastLED, version 3001005
 * FlexCAN, collin80's fork, master branch commit 9458e8e397b2ad682b9c96ed23c567abd488615f
 * Snooze, unknown which version is installed
