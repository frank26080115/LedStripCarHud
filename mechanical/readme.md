# 3D CAD models of the 3D printed case #

Source files are SolidWorks 2016

STEP and IGES files are provided for people without SolidWorks

I do not share STL files because it's a horrible format for sharing online, I would much rather you download STEP or IGES files and convert it to STL yourself. STEP and IGES allows you to edit the model, STL does not.
